# Housing Price Prediction: A Comparative Study of Non-linear Regression Models

## Project Overview
This project implements and compares multiple non-linear regression techniques for predicting housing prices using the Ames Housing Dataset from Kaggle. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of three different modeling approaches:

- **Polynomial Regression** (degrees 1-3)
- **Exponential/Logarithmic Model**
- **Spline Interpolation**

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data?select=sample_submission.csv)
- Training set: 1,460 records with 81 features
- Target variable: SalePrice

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and outlier handling
- Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations
- Multiple non-linear modeling approaches
- Model performance comparison using RMSE and R² metrics

## Results Summary
| Model | Test RMSE | Test R² |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Polynomial Regression (Degree 2) | $35,040.37 | 0.8399 |
| Exponential/Logarithmic Model | $36,017.41 | 0.8309 |
| Spline Interpolation | $199,133.13 | -4.1698 |

**Best Performing Model**: Second-degree polynomial regression with R² = 0.8399

## Technologies Used

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `ModSim_Final_GroupProject`

## Key Findings
- The second-degree polynomial model captures the non-linear relationships in housing prices effectively
- Log transformation helps normalize skewed features like SalePrice
- Feature engineering and proper preprocessing significantly impact model performance
- Spline interpolation requires multivariate implementation for better results

## Future Improvements
- Implement Generalized Additive Models (GAM) for better spline-based predictions
- Add ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) for comparison
- Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation
- Feature engineering to capture complex interactions
